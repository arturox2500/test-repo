# Development Process

## 1. Methodology
- The project follows an **iterative and incremental approach**, aligned with Agile principles and incorporating some Extreme Programming (XP) and Kanban practices.  
- Minimum viable functionality is developed, tested, and improved in short cycles.  
- **Scrum is not applied**.

## 2. Task Management
- Tasks are managed using **GitHub Issues** and **GitHub Projects**, with a visual board to track progress and prioritize work effectively.

## 3. Version Control
- **Git** is used for source code management, employing a branching strategy to organize development.  
- Metrics such as the number of commits, branches, and merges are tracked to monitor repository usage and collaboration.

## 4. Continuous Integration (CI/CD)
- **GitHub Actions** automates the build and test processes on every push or pull request.  
- Workflows handle tasks such as automated testing, code validation, and deployment, ensuring high-quality, reliable software delivery.  
- **Note:** So far, only **Continuous Integration (CI)** has been implemented. **Docker-based deployment** and further DevOps workflows will be added in later phases.
